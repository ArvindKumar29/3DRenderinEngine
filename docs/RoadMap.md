# Roadmap

This is a plan, not a promise. The order of the tiers matters more than the dates, and anything that slips is noted in the [devlog](devlog/).

## Setup (October 2026)

- [x] CMake and vcpkg toolchain
- [x] Empty window

## Milestone 1: first triangle (November)

- [ ] Instance, device and swapchain
- [ ] Frames in flight and command buffers
- [ ] Shader pipeline with runtime compilation
- [ ] Triangle on screen with zero validation errors

## Milestone 2: geometry and tools (late November)

- [ ] GPU memory with VMA
- [ ] Vertex and index buffers with staging uploads
- [ ] Depth buffering
- [ ] Free camera
- [ ] ImGui debug UI

## Milestone 3: assets (December)

- [ ] Textures with stb_image
- [ ] glTF static meshes with fastgltf
- [ ] Descriptor indexing (bindless textures)
- [ ] CPU and GPU profiling zones with Tracy

## Foundation (January to February)

- [ ] Physically based shading (metallic-roughness)
- [ ] Image-based lighting
- [ ] Data-oriented scene graph and transform hierarchy
- [ ] Material system
- [ ] Thin Vulkan wrapper extracted from repeated patterns
- [ ] Shadow maps for directional lights
- [ ] HDR, tone mapping and bloom
- [ ] MSAA

## Core (March to June)

- [ ] Indirect rendering, CPU frustum culling and LODs
- [ ] Skeletal animation baseline
- [ ] SSAO
- [ ] Cascaded shadow maps
- [ ] Asynchronous asset loading and a job system
- [ ] Texture compression (BC7 or KTX2) with mipmaps
- [ ] Profiling pass with Nsight or Radeon GPU Profiler and RenderDoc
- [ ] Benchmarks and architecture notes

## Stretch (July onward)

- [ ] Animation blending and morph targets
- [ ] GPU-driven culling with Hi-Z and multi-draw indirect
- [ ] Clustered forward lighting
- [ ] Render graph with automatic barriers
- [ ] Temporal anti-aliasing
- [ ] Custom work-stealing job scheduler
- [ ] Ray queries for shadows or ambient occlusion
